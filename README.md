# Jackson Kafka Avro serializer

This is an implementation of Kafka Avro Serializer using Apache Jackson. In comparison to the official [Kafka Avro
Serializer](https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/serdes-develop/serdes-avro.html) it has the following advantages:

1. No code generation. No need to use ugly generated classes. You can use nice POJOs.
2. Full power of Jackson
3. First-class support for Kotlin
